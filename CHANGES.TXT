What's new?

- New feature: gyroscope data is now subject to head motion tracking with I-VT algorithm

Angular velocity is taken from gyroscope data, while linear acceleration from accelerometer cannot be used to integrate speed, due to unsolvable Madgwick filter in absence of magnetometer. Acceleration data in its current state can be only used for derivation of jolt, which allows to trace the moments of motion onset and offset.

- Dependencies added: eyestudio, angles, pympi-ling, pandas 0.21.1
- requirements.txt file for pip.exe added containing the list of dependencies
- New feature: md5 hashsum added to every file tag in settings.xml allowing to compare with data files used previously
- LICENSE added (MIT).
